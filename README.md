# Random-Walk-Simulation
A Java program that simulates a 2D random walk. The user inputs the number of steps, and the program moves randomly in four directions (up, down, left, right), displaying coordinates at each step. It also calculates the squared distance from the starting point. Uses Java, Math.random(), loops, and conditionals.
